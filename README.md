# c-examples
Just a place where I mess around with C code. Although you'll find readme's for a lot of the code/projects on here, not all of them will work or compile properly. I just want to put that up front and make it perfectly clear in case you happen to run into this repo.

If you do find anything useful or that you like, feel free to take it and do whatever you want with it since everything here is under the MIT license.
